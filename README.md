## Harmony Chatter - back end
This is a backend for a chat app that would be hosted by a user to either use in a local network or a portforwarded configuration either way there will need to be some signifigant building around this but for nowe a uiser can only belong to one instance would need to improve this in time but would require a blockchain like network to verify and practically share destinations around the space which goes against the whole idea for now not doing that and plan to keep it very local to the network

Plan on a frontend soon and maybe a native mobile version in the future
